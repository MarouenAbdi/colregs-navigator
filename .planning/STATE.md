# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-14)

**Core value:** Given any two-vessel encounter, correctly classify it under COLREGS and clearly explain — not just assert — which vessel must give way and why.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — interactive chart sandbox

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal Layers build order chosen — domain engine → persistence → API → UI → sharing/gallery. Nothing is end-to-end demoable until Phase 4; deliberate tradeoff to validate the highest-risk COLREGS logic in isolation first.
- Roadmap: Granularity is "coarse" (3-5 phases) — merged research's proposed Persistence and tRPC API phases into a single Phase 3, since both are conventional, low-risk, HIGH-confidence patterns per research.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (Rules Engine) and Phase 4 (Interactive Chart) are flagged in research/SUMMARY.md as likely needing deeper research during planning (`--research-phase`): exact doubt-band width, Rule 7 risk-of-collision formula, and sector-boundary conventions for Phase 2; drag-gesture implementation details for Phase 4.
